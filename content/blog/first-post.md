# My first blog post

For something that gets used almost every day of a man's life, a wallet is very rarely a considered purchase. Whereas female friends will pick their next purse months in advance and save accordingly, most men have either a battered wallet that was given to them as a gift years ago or will have a new one that they had to impulse purchase when the aforementioned model fell apart. Rarely is it a considered purchase and therefore rarely is it truly fit for purpose.

But what's the use in taking a lot of time picking out the right trousers if you're not going to take the same time and consideration over the far-more-used accessory in your back pocket?

Gentlemen, it's time to evolve â€“ and time to find a wallet that suits your spending needs. There are four main tribes in the wallet world and each has very specific demands for its currency carrier depending on how you like to settle the bill, plus one newcomer. Take a look at our breakdown of these tribes below and have a browse of some of the best wallets for each.
